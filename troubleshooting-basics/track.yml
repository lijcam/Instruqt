title: Kubernetes troubleshooting basics
teaser: Know where you are in the stack.
description: |-
  The first time your application disappears, crashes, — wait, where did all the nodes go — from your Kubernetes cluster can be over-welling.
  Key to being able to quickly triage issues is having the knowledge to know where to look first — know where you are in the stack.

  This lab will help orientate you in a Kubernetes environment and allow you to practice troubleshooting techniques free from production outage risks.

  The challenges feature troubleshooting from the OpenShift console, with option for command line.
