notes:
- type: text
  contents: |-
    The container-based deployment of the Pacman application worked better than expected, and performance testing completed without issue.

    Another test is happening this weekend, and the delivery team has taken your learnings from the last exercise, and distilled them as [Kubernetes API objects](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/kubernetes-objects).

    This task, is to deploy the Pacman application again, but using Kubernetes objects.
