teaser: Learn to use the Red Hat OpenShift Compliance Operator to scan for and remediate
  security issues.
description: "Security and compliance are critical requirements for any organisation
  looking to adopt a secure platform to build and run operations. Fortunately for
  Red Hat OpenShift users, security is a core focus of the platform, and is built-in
  in many ways. \n\nThe Compliance Operator is one way we build security into the
  OpenShift platform. The Compliance Operator allows organisations to scan clusters
  for security issues; report on those issues, using NIST standard formats; and remediate
  security and compliance issues using a Kubernetes-native approach.\n\nThis lab will
  take you through:\n  - Installing the Compliance Operator on Red Hat OpenShift clusters\n
  \ - Scanning clusters for security and compliance issues\n  - Scheduling cluster
  security and compliance scans\n  - Accessing security and compliance results and
  creating reports\n  - Remediating security and compliance issues using a Kubernetes-native
  approach"
